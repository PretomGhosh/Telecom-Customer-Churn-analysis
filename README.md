# Telecom-Customer-Churn-analysis
The dataset was collected from Maven analytics to analyze the customer churn of a telecom company in USA and I have tried to find out the following insights from it:
1) which promotional offers are retaining customer for a long time?
2) from which city less customers are buying our service?
3) from which city highest revenue is coming?
4) which contract type is earning the most revenue?
5) what is the most common reason for customer churning?
6) How many customers joined the company during the last quarter? How many customers joined?
7) What is the customer profile for a customer that churned, joined, and stayed? Are they different?
8) What seem to be the key drivers of customer churn?
9) Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?

My analysis could be a great use for the marketing and sales department which will help them to decide the perfect strategy to implement in the future.
